The football match for the last day pits Brazil and Uruguay, the only ones still in the race for the title. The decisive clash at the Maracanã Stadium therefore served as a real final, except that Brazil could be satisfied with a draw to lift the cup.
To everyone's surprise, it was Uruguay who won the match and pocketed their second World Cup. Under despondency and confusion, FIFA President Jules Rimet handed over the cup in a rather discreet manner. Brazilian goalkeeper Moacyr Barbosa carried this defeat all his life, wrongly accusing of being responsible for the defeat. He said in 1994: “In Brazil, the maximum sentence for a crime is 30 years. I have been paying for more than 43 years for a crime I did not commit.”";Ademir;8;;

To everyone's surprise, the Germans will triumph over the big favorites Hungary, undefeated for 4 years and Olympic champion.
